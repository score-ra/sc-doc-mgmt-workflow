I have gathered comprehensive information about GoHighLevel (GHL) training needs for both general end users and commercial real estate brokers specifically. Let me now compile this intelligence into two prioritized lists as requested.

## GoHighLevel End User Training Needs - Intelligence Report

Based on extensive research across user forums, support documentation, feature requests, and agency experiences, the most common aspects of using a GoHighLevel-based system that end users (clients of agencies) need training for can be categorized into three priority levels:

### **HIGH PRIORITY Training Needs**

**Workflow and Automation Setup**[1][2][3][4][5][6]
End users frequently struggle with understanding how workflows trigger, how to configure automation properly, and troubleshooting why automations don't fire correctly. Common issues include missing triggers, wrong filters, contacts not entering the right pipeline stage, and workflows that don't execute as expected. Users need training on basic workflow logic, trigger types, action sequencing, and using wait steps appropriately.

**Calendar and Appointment Booking**[3][7][8][9][10][11]
Calendar setup and management represents one of the most problematic areas for end users. Challenges include configuring availability settings, understanding round-robin vs. personal calendars, timezone confusion (especially for multi-location teams), integration with Google Calendar, setting up automated reminders, managing rescheduled appointments, and preventing double-bookings. The timezone issue alone causes widespread confusion when users across different regions try to schedule appointments.[11]

**Email and SMS Configuration**[2][12][13][14][15][3]
Email deliverability, SMTP setup, sender authentication, and SMS compliance (A2P 10DLC) are consistently cited as major pain points. Users struggle with email going to spam, understanding sender reputation, configuring "from" addresses correctly, setting up email templates that work across workflows, and navigating SMS regulatory requirements. The technical nature of email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) overwhelms non-technical users.[13]

**Contact and Pipeline Management**[16][17][18][3]
Users need training on organizing contacts effectively, understanding pipeline stages, moving opportunities between stages, assigning contacts to the correct team members, using tags and custom fields properly, and understanding the difference between contacts and opportunities. Many struggle with the concept that opportunities cannot easily transfer between sub-accounts, leading to duplication issues.[3]

**Form Builder and Custom Fields**[19][20][21][18]
Form creation causes confusion around custom field mapping, conditional logic setup, understanding why form templates create unwanted custom fields, managing the proliferation of custom fields across multiple forms, and ensuring form submissions properly populate contact records. Users often don't realize that form templates automatically create custom fields that need manual deletion.[19]

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY Training Needs**

**Conversations and Communication Management**[12]
Users need guidance on managing the unified inbox, understanding how different channels (email, SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram) appear in conversations, marking messages as read/unread, using internal notes vs. external messages, and setting up proper notification preferences. The conversation interface can be overwhelming when multiple communication channels converge.

**Sub-Account Structure and Multi-Location Setup**[2][3]
For agencies serving multi-location clients, understanding sub-account architecture, how data flows between agency and sub-accounts, user permissions and roles, and managing settings at different levels requires dedicated training. The concept of agency view vs. sub-account view confuses many new users.

**Integration Setup**[22][23][24]
Connecting third-party tools like Zapier, webhooks, payment processors (Stripe), social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), and calendar services requires technical understanding. Users particularly struggle with WhatsApp Business integration and the coexistence vs. Cloud API distinction.[23][24]

**Reporting and Analytics**[25][2]
Users need training on accessing built-in reports, understanding metrics and KPIs, creating custom dashboards, tracking campaign performance, and interpreting the data GHL provides. Many don't utilize reporting features because they don't understand where to find them or how to customize them.

**Template Management and Snapshots**[26]
Understanding how to use pre-built templates, save custom templates, apply snapshots to new accounts, and customize templates without breaking functionality requires guidance. Users often struggle with the concept of snapshots and when to use them vs. building from scratch.

### **LOW PRIORITY Training Needs**

**Membership and Community Features**[27]
Creating and managing membership sites, community forums, and course content within GHL is less commonly used by most clients, making this a lower training priority unless specifically relevant to their business model.

**Advanced Workflow Features**[4][28]
Features like AI workflow builders, complex conditional branching, webhook integrations, and advanced automation logic are typically needed only by power users and can be addressed after mastering basics.

**White-Label and SaaS Configuration**[1][2]
Most end users (clients) don't need training on white-labeling, SaaS mode setup, or agency-level configurations—these are typically handled by the agency providing the GHL service.

**Social Planner and Content Scheduling**[29][22]
While useful, social media posting and content calendar management is often secondary to core CRM functions for most businesses and can be trained later in the adoption process.

**Reputation Management**[30][2]
Review request automation and reputation monitoring, while valuable, tends to be a "set it and forget it" feature that requires less ongoing user interaction once initially configured.

---

## Commercial Real Estate Broker-Specific GHL Training Needs

For commercial real estate (CRE) brokers using GoHighLevel, training needs differ significantly from general users due to the unique characteristics of CRE transactions, longer sales cycles, and specialized workflows:

### **HIGH PRIORITY Training Needs - CRE Specific**

**Deal Pipeline and Opportunity Tracking**[31][32][33][34][35][36][37]
CRE brokers must master pipeline management for tracking complex, multi-stage deals that can last months or years. Training should cover creating custom pipeline stages specific to CRE (prospecting, qualification, property tour, LOI, due diligence, negotiation, closing), moving deals through stages, tracking deal value and commission projections, managing multiple stakeholders per deal, and using custom fields to capture property-specific data (square footage, lease terms, property type, zoning). Unlike residential, CRE deals involve multiple decision-makers and longer nurture cycles requiring sophisticated pipeline visibility.[36][37]

**Property Listing Management and Marketing Automation**[32][38][39][40][41]
Brokers need training on creating property listing workflows, automating property marketing campaigns, managing property-specific email sequences, creating custom fields for property attributes (location, size, tenant type, lease rates, cap rates), linking properties to multiple contacts (owners, tenants, investors), and generating automated property marketing materials. CRE marketing requires property-centric automation rather than just contact-centric workflows.[39][41]

**Multi-Stakeholder Contact Management**[33][35][42][32]
CRE transactions involve landlords, tenants, investors, property managers, brokers, attorneys, and lenders. Training must address creating contact hierarchies, linking multiple contacts to single properties/deals, managing relationships between entities (tenant companies, investor groups), tracking communication across stakeholder groups, and using tags to segment by stakeholder type. Understanding how to manage complex relationship networks is critical.[42]

**Long-Term Lead Nurturing and Drip Campaigns**[43][38][40][44]
Given CRE's extended sales cycles (often 6-24 months), brokers need extensive training on building multi-touch nurture sequences, creating value-based content drips (market reports, property alerts, investment insights), segmenting leads by property interest and timeline, re-engaging cold leads, and measuring engagement over extended periods. The training should emphasize patience and consistent touchpoints rather than quick conversions.[44][36]

**Calendar Management for Property Tours and Meetings**[34][32]
Brokers require training on scheduling property tours, coordinating multiple stakeholder calendars, blocking time for site visits, integrating driving time between properties, managing showing appointments with automated confirmations and reminders, and handling tour reschedules. CRE tours often require coordinating property managers, tenants-in-place, and building access.

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY Training Needs - CRE Specific**

**Market Report and Content Automation**[40][41][45]
Training on creating automated market update emails, property alert systems based on saved searches, quarterly market report distributions, comparative market analysis (CMA) delivery, and investment opportunity broadcasts. CRE brokers who consistently provide market intelligence build stronger relationships.[45]

**Document Management and Deal Documentation**[37][46][34]
Guidance on storing and organizing LOIs, purchase agreements, lease documents, property financials, due diligence checklists, and closing documents within GHL. Training should cover document templates, e-signature integration, and document workflow automation for compliance.

**Financial Tracking and Commission Calculations**[31][33][37]
Brokers need to understand tracking deal financials, projected commissions, co-broker splits, estimated closing dates for revenue forecasting, and integrating financial data with pipeline stages. Custom fields for financial metrics are essential for CRE deal analysis.

**Tenant and Lease Tracking (for Landlord Representation)**[47][48][49][32][42]
For brokers representing landlords, training on tracking tenant lease expirations, renewal opportunities, tenant communication workflows, maintenance request systems, and tenant satisfaction surveys. This differs from traditional brokerage and requires property management-adjacent skills.[42]

**Multi-Channel Prospecting (LinkedIn, Email, Phone)**[36][40][44]
Training on using GHL for LinkedIn outreach to commercial property owners and investors, coordinating cold email campaigns, integrating call tracking, and creating multi-channel prospecting sequences. CRE prospecting often targets specific property owners or companies rather than mass markets.[44]

### **LOW PRIORITY Training Needs - CRE Specific**

**Investor Relations and Capital Raising**[37][47][31]
For brokers involved in syndication or investment sales, training on investor communication automation, distribution reporting, and investor portal management. This applies to a subset of CRE brokers focused on investment properties.

**Advanced Analytics and Market Intelligence Integration**[46][50][43]
Integration with specialized CRE data platforms (CoStar, LoopNet, REIS), AI-powered market analysis tools, and predictive analytics. While valuable, these are advanced features that can be layered in after core competencies are established.[50]

**Environmental and Compliance Tracking**[49][37]
For brokers handling complex transactions, training on tracking environmental assessments, zoning compliance, permit management, and sustainability initiatives. This is specialized to certain property types and transaction complexities.[49]

**Automated Valuation and Underwriting Tools**[46][37]
Integration of property valuation models, NOI calculations, cap rate analysis, and automated underwriting within GHL workflows. Most brokers use dedicated software for this and would need advanced training to replicate in GHL.

**White-Label Client Portal for Property Owners**[51]
Customizing client portals specifically for property owners to view their listings, track showings, receive offers, and monitor marketing activity. This is valuable but secondary to core brokerage functions.

***

### Key Insights from Research

**1. Technical Complexity vs. Business Users**: The most significant training gap exists because GHL is feature-rich but not always intuitive for non-technical users. Email authentication, workflow logic, and calendar timezone settings require technical knowledge many end users lack.[13][11][3]

**2. Onboarding Critical**: Research shows that proper live onboarding significantly reduces user confusion and improves adoption rates. Agencies that rely solely on email instructions or documentation see much higher user frustration.[2]

**3. CRE Differs from Residential**: Commercial real estate requires fundamentally different CRM usage patterns—longer deal cycles, more stakeholders per transaction, property-centric rather than buyer-centric workflows, and significantly higher deal values requiring more sophisticated tracking.[35][33][31][36]

**4. Common Failure Points**: Workflows not firing correctly, calendar timezone confusion, email deliverability issues, and custom field proliferation are the most frequently cited problems across all user types.[6][11][3][19]

**5. Multi-Location Complexity**: Businesses with multiple locations or remote teams face compounded challenges with GHL's timezone handling and sub-account structure, requiring specialized training.[11][3]

This intelligence provides a data-driven foundation for developing targeted training programs that address the actual pain points users experience, prioritized by frequency and impact on user success.
