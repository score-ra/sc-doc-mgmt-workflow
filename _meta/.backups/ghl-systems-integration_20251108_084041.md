## Platform Architecture Foundation

GoHighLevel serves as the foundational CRM and marketing automation platform that powers Symphony Core's entire service delivery model. The Extendly Ultimate Small Business Snapshot provides a comprehensive starting point that transforms the otherwise empty GoHighLevel environment into a fully operational business system within days rather than months.

### Core System Components Integration
