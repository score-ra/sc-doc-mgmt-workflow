# KB-004: Client Onboarding Checklist

⚠️ **This document has moved to a new location.**

## New Location

The authoritative client onboarding procedure is now located at:

**`04-operations/sops/client-onboarding/client-onboarding-procedure.md`**

## Why Did It Move?

KB-004 was moved to establish a single source of truth for client onboarding procedures. As the authoritative implementation guide, it now resides in the operations/SOPs directory rather than training materials.

## What Changed?

- **File Location:** `06-team-training/platform-training/` → `04-operations/sops/client-onboarding/`
- **File Name:** `kb-004-client-onboarding-checklist.md` → `client-onboarding-procedure.md`
- **Content:** No changes - same comprehensive 13-step onboarding guide
