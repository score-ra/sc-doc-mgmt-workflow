- **Reviews AI:** Automatically responds to Google, Facebook, and Yelp reviews

Yes! Professional and Enterprise plans include unlimited usage of all AI Employee features. No per-minute charges, no per-message fees, no limits.

We do have a fair use policy for extreme usage (like 10,000+ Voice AI minutes/month), but 99% of businesses never reach that threshold.

### Can the AI handle complex conversations?
Yes! The AI is trained to handle multi-turn conversations, answer questions, book appointments, and qualify leads. It gets smarter over time by learning from your business.

For very complex situations, the AI can seamlessly transfer to a human team member.

No—it enhances your team! The AI handles repetitive tasks (answering the same questions, booking appointments, following up on leads) so your team can focus on high-value activities like closing deals and serving customers.

Many clients find they can do more business with the same team size.

### Can I turn off AI features I don't want?
Yes! You have complete control. Turn individual AI features on or off anytime. Want Voice AI but not Reviews AI? No problem. Professional and Enterprise plans include everything—use what you need.
