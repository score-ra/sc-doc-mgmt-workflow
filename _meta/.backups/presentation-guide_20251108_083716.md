## Presentation Best Practices

### Before Presenting

1. **Practice** - Run through presentation at least twice
2. **Test Equipment** - Verify projector, screen share, audio
3. **Download Offline** - Don't rely on internet connection
4. **Prepare Backup** - Have PDF version ready
5. **Customize** - Adjust examples to match audience
6. **Time Yourself** - Ensure presentation fits allotted time
7. **Prepare Q&A** - Anticipate common questions

### During Presentation

1. **Engage Audience** - Ask questions, encourage participation
2. **Focus on Benefits** - Show value, not just features
3. **Be Conversational** - Don't just read slides
4. **Use Pause Points** - Allow time for questions
5. **Adapt to Audience** - Skip/expand sections based on interest

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Fonts Not Displaying Correctly

**Problem:** Roboto or Inter fonts not showing after opening presentation
**Solution:**
```
1. Install Google Fonts on your system:
   - Visit: https://fonts.google.com
   - Download Roboto, Inter, Source Sans Pro
   - Install font files
   - Restart PowerPoint/editing tool
2. Or use fallback fonts:
   - Roboto → Arial Black or Helvetica Bold
   - Inter → Calibri or Arial
   - Source Sans Pro → Arial or Helvetica
```

### Issue: Colors Look Different After Export

**Problem:** Colors change when exporting from Google Slides to PowerPoint
**Solution:**
```
1. Use exact hex codes in Google Slides (not "theme colors")
2. Click color → Custom → Enter hex code: #3682AEFF
3. Verify colors after export
4. Adjust if needed in PowerPoint
```

### Issue: Logo Appears Pixelated

**Problem:** Logo looks blurry when projected
**Solution:**
```
1. Use high-resolution version (SVG preferred)
2. Download logo at largest available size
3. Insert as high-res PNG (not JPG)
4. Don't stretch/enlarge logo beyond original size
5. If SVG available, use that instead (infinite scaling)
```

### Issue: File Size Too Large

**Problem:** Presentation file is 50+ MB, difficult to email/share
**Solution:**
```
1. Compress images:
   - PowerPoint: File → Compress Pictures → 150-220 ppi
2. Remove unused slides/layouts:
   - View → Slide Master → Delete unused layouts
3. Avoid embedded videos (link instead)
4. Export PDF version for email (usually smaller)
5. Upload to Google Drive, share link instead
```

### Issue: Animations Not Working After Upload to Google Slides

**Problem:** PowerPoint animations lost when converting to Google Slides
**Solution:**
```
1. Simplify animations before upload
2. Recreate key animations in Google Slides
3. Or keep PowerPoint version for presentations
4. Use Google Slides for collaboration, PowerPoint for delivery
```

### Issue: Can't Edit Master Presentation (File Locked)

**Problem:** Multiple people editing, file conflicts
**Solution:**
```
1. Use Google Slides for collaboration (real-time editing)
2. Or implement check-out system:
   - Comment in team chat: "Editing master presentation"
   - Make changes
   - Save and notify when done
3. Create working copies for major edits
4. Merge changes back to master when complete
```
