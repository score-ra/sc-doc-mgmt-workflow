## The Connecticut Small Business Reality

You're great at what you do. But while you're installing HVAC systems in Hartford, showing properties in New Haven, or serving clients in Fairfield County, potential customers are calling, texting, and visiting your website—and getting no response.

**The problem:** 67% of leads go to competitors who respond first.

**The solution:** Marketing automation that works automatically, captures every lead, and follows up instantly—so you never miss another opportunity.
