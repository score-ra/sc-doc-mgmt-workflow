**Visual:** Presenter on camera, welcoming smile
**Voiceover:**
```
Welcome to Symphony Core! I'm [Name], and I'll be your account manager throughout your onboarding journey.

First, congratulations on making the decision to automate your business. You're about to experience what hundreds of Connecticut small businesses have discovered: automation saves you time, grows your revenue, and lets you focus on what you do best - serving your customers.

I'm excited to get started with you. Let me walk you through exactly what to expect over the next few weeks.
```

### Section 2: Onboarding Timeline Overview (0:30-1:15)

**Visual:** Screen share showing timeline graphic
**Voiceover:**
```
Your onboarding process is divided into four phases, and we'll complete everything in about two to three weeks.

Phase One is Discovery and Setup. That's where we are right now. We'll gather information about your business, set up your account, and configure the foundation of your automation system. This takes about three to five days.

Phase Two is Configuration and Customization. We'll build out your lead capture forms, set up your appointment calendars, create your automated workflows, and customize everything to match your brand. This is the meaty part - about one to two weeks.

Phase Three is Training and Launch. We'll train you and your team on how to use the platform, test everything thoroughly, and then launch your automation live. This takes about two to three days.

And Phase Four is Optimization and Support. After launch, we stick with you to fine-tune your automation, answer questions, and make sure you're getting amazing results. This is ongoing.

### Section 3: What We Need From You (1:15-2:00)

**Visual:** Checklist on screen
**Voiceover:**
```
Now, here's what we need from you to make this onboarding smooth and successful.

First, we need you to complete the client profile questionnaire we sent you. This helps us understand your business, your goals, and your customers. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes.

Second, please provide us with access to any accounts we'll be integrating - things like your website, Facebook page, Google Business Profile, and any existing CRM or tools you're using. Don't worry, we'll walk you through each one step by step.

Third, schedule your working sessions with us. We'll send you calendar links. These are hands-on sessions where we configure your automation together. They're crucial for staying on schedule.

And fourth - and this is important - please respond to our messages within 24 hours if possible. The faster we can communicate, the faster we can get you up and running.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Display checklist items on screen

### Section 4: Platform Tour (2:00-3:00)

**Visual:** Screen recording of Symphony Core platform
**Voiceover:**
```
Let me give you a quick tour of what you'll have access to once we're done.

This is your dashboard - your mission control. You'll see all your leads here, your appointments, your active conversations with customers, and your key metrics. Everything in one place.

Here's your calendar where all your appointments automatically appear. Clients can book directly from your website, and you'll get text and email notifications for every new booking.

This is your contacts area - your complete customer database. Every lead, every customer, every interaction - all tracked automatically. No more spreadsheets or lost sticky notes.

And over here are your automations - the magic behind the scenes. These are the workflows that automatically follow up with leads, send appointment reminders, request reviews, and nurture your customers. Once we set these up, they run 24/7 without you lifting a finger.

We'll train you on all of this in detail during Phase Three, so don't feel overwhelmed. By the time we're done, you'll be a pro.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Slow, clear tour of platform
- Highlight key areas: dashboard, calendar, contacts, automations
- Use cursor to point to features
- Don't go too fast (they'll learn details later)

You're not alone in this process. We provide comprehensive support every step of the way.

Your primary contact is me - [Name]. You can reach me by email, phone, or text anytime during business hours. I'll be checking in with you regularly throughout onboarding.

You also have access to our support team for technical questions. They're available via email and our chat widget.

We've created an onboarding checklist that shows every task, who's responsible, and the timeline. You'll receive this in your email. This is your roadmap - refer to it anytime you're wondering what comes next.

And we have a complete knowledge base with training videos, how-to guides, and troubleshooting resources. You can access this 24/7.

Remember: there are no stupid questions. If you're confused about something, ask. We're here to help you succeed.

**Visual:** Metrics dashboard or goals graphic
**Voiceover:**
```
Let's talk about what success looks like. Our goal is to help you achieve measurable results.

We'll track things like lead response time - how quickly you follow up with new inquiries. The industry average is 4 hours. With Symphony Core, you'll respond in 4 seconds.

We'll monitor appointment booking rates, follow-up completion rates, and customer engagement. And most importantly, we'll track the one metric that matters most to your business: appointments booked or sales closed.

After 30 days, we'll review your numbers together and optimize your automation to maximize results. By 90 days, you should see significant improvement in efficiency and revenue.

This isn't just software - it's a partnership focused on your growth.
