## Script

### Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Symphony Core logo, title "Small Business Automation Platform"
**Duration:** 10 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Are you tired of manually following up with leads, scheduling appointments, and chasing reviews? Let me show you how Symphony Core automates all of that for your small business.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Upbeat, energetic tone
- Background music (soft, non-distracting)
- Display title for full 10 seconds

---

### Slide 2: Who This Is For
**Visual:** Icons or images of target industries (medical, restaurants, real estate)
**Duration:** 20 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
This video is for small business owners in Connecticut who are overwhelmed by manual tasks. If you're a medical practice, restaurant, real estate agent, or professional service provider spending hours each day on repetitive work, this is for you.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Speak directly to camera/audience
- Highlight industry icons as mentioned
- Establish empathy with audience

---

### Slide 3: The Problem - Manual Lead Follow-Up
**Visual:** Diagram showing chaos of manual processes
**Duration:** 30 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Here's the problem: When a lead comes in from your website, Facebook, or Google, someone on your team has to manually respond. But you're busy with customers, in meetings, or handling emergencies. By the time you follow up, hours or even days have passed, and that lead has already contacted your competitor.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Use frustrated/stressed tone to convey pain
- Show visual of leads piling up
- Emphasize time delays

---

### Slide 4: The Problem - Lost Appointments
**Visual:** Calendar with conflicts, missed appointments
**Duration:** 25 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Then there's scheduling. Phone tag, double bookings, no-shows. You're wasting time confirming appointments, sending reminders, and dealing with last-minute cancellations. It's frustrating for you AND your customers.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Visual showing scheduling chaos
- Highlight pain points: phone tag, no-shows
- Frustrated but hopeful tone

---

### Slide 5: The Problem - Manual Sales Process
**Visual:** Cluttered spreadsheet or sticky notes
**Duration:** 25 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
And don't even get me started on tracking your sales pipeline. Leads get lost in email threads, follow-ups are forgotten, and you have no idea which prospects are hot and which have gone cold. You're leaving money on the table every single day.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Show disorganized sales process visually
- Emphasize lost revenue
- Building tension for solution

---

### Slide 6: Introducing Symphony Core
**Visual:** Symphony Core logo, clean platform interface
**Duration:** 30 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
That's where Symphony Core comes in. We provide a ready-to-configure automation platform built specifically for Connecticut small businesses. Instead of piecing together multiple tools or building from scratch, you get a complete automation ecosystem that works right out of the box.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Shift to solution-focused tone (positive, confident)
- Show clean, organized platform
- Emphasize "ready to configure"

---

### Slide 7: How It Works - Overview
**Visual:** Simple 4-step process diagram
**Duration:** 30 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Here's how it works: First, we capture leads from your website, social media, and ads automatically. Second, we nurture those leads with personalized messages. Third, we automate scheduling and follow-up. And fourth, we help you get more five-star reviews. Let me show you each of these in action.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Highlight each step as mentioned
- Use cursor to point to diagram elements
- Upbeat, confident tone

---

### Slide 8: Lead Capture Automation
**Visual:** Screenshot or diagram of lead capture flow
**Duration:** 45 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Let's start with lead capture. When someone fills out a form on your website, clicks your Facebook ad, or messages you on Google, Symphony Core instantly captures that lead and adds them to your CRM. No manual data entry. No lost leads. Everything is automatically tracked and organized.

Within seconds, your new lead gets a personalized text message or email confirming you received their inquiry and letting them know what to expect next. You're responding instantly, 24/7, even while you sleep.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Show lead form → automatic capture → instant response
- Use cursor to highlight automation flow
- Emphasize "instantly" and "24/7"

---

### Slide 9: Lead Nurture Sequences
**Visual:** Automated email/SMS sequence timeline
**Duration:** 45 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
But we don't stop there. Symphony Core automatically nurtures leads with a sequence of helpful messages over the following days and weeks. These aren't generic spam - they're personalized based on what service they're interested in and how they found you.

For example, if someone requested a quote for your services, they'll automatically receive educational content, case studies, and reminders to schedule a consultation. All without you lifting a finger. We stay top-of-mind until they're ready to buy.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Show timeline of messages going out
- Highlight personalization
- Emphasize "automatic" and "personalized"

---

### Slide 10: Appointment Scheduling
**Visual:** Online calendar booking interface
**Duration:** 45 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Now let's talk about scheduling. Instead of phone tag, your leads can book appointments directly from their phone. They see your real-time availability, pick a time that works for them, and boom - it's on your calendar.

Symphony Core automatically sends confirmation messages, reminder texts before the appointment, and even follows up afterward. No-shows drop dramatically because people get reminded via text the day before. And if they need to reschedule, they can do it themselves without calling your office.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Show booking calendar interface
- Highlight automatic reminders
- Show before/after no-show statistics if available

---

### Slide 11: Sales Pipeline Automation
**Visual:** Kanban board or pipeline view
**Duration:** 45 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Every lead automatically enters your sales pipeline, organized by stage. New inquiry, quote sent, proposal delivered, closed won. You can see exactly where every prospect is at a glance.

And here's the magic: Symphony Core automatically moves leads through your pipeline and triggers the right follow-up at the right time. Quote sent? Automatic follow-up in three days. Proposal viewed but not signed? Reminder message goes out. No more forgotten follow-ups. No more lost deals.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Show pipeline board with leads moving
- Highlight automatic stage triggers
- Use cursor to show lead progression

---

### Slide 12: Review Generation
**Visual:** Five-star reviews, review request flow
**Duration:** 40 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
Finally, let's talk about reviews. After every completed service or sale, Symphony Core automatically asks your happy customers for a review. We send them a simple text message with a direct link to leave a Google review or Facebook recommendation.

Happy customers leave five-star reviews. Unhappy customers get a chance to give you private feedback before posting publicly. More reviews means better online reputation, which means more leads. It's a beautiful cycle.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Show review request message
- Display five-star review examples (sanitized)
- Emphasize automation and reputation building

---

### Slide 13: Results & Benefits
**Visual:** Before/after statistics, ROI metrics
**Duration:** 45 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
So what does all this automation actually achieve? Our Connecticut small business clients report responding to leads 10 times faster, booking 30% more appointments, and getting 5 times more online reviews - all with less manual work than before.

Instead of spending hours each day on repetitive tasks, you focus on what you do best: serving your customers. Symphony Core handles the boring stuff in the background, automatically, 24/7, without breaks or vacation days.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Display statistics prominently
- Use client testimonials if available (with permission)
- Confident, results-focused tone

---

### Slide 14: Implementation & Support
**Visual:** Timeline, support team
**Duration:** 30 seconds

**Voiceover:**
```
And the best part? You don't have to figure this out alone. We provide full onboarding, customization for your specific business, and ongoing support. Most clients are up and running in just two to three weeks, with comprehensive training included.

We're a local Connecticut team, so you're not dealing with a faceless corporation or offshore support. We know your market, we understand your challenges, and we're here to help you succeed.
```

**Production Notes:**
- Show onboarding timeline
- Highlight local Connecticut presence
- Friendly, supportive tone
