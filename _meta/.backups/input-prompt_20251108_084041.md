Create a document that standardizes use of tags within this repo. These tags are included in the YAML block. Also create a best practice statement that allows easier decision making on when to introduce new tags. The initial list of tags needs to be created by understanding the repo context. Use this document (C:\Users\Rohit\workspace\ObsidianVault\meta\tags.md) as an inspiration. Note this repo does not have any personal documents, only use work context.
