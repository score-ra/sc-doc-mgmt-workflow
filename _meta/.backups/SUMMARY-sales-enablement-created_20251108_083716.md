## Key Intelligence Preserved

### Demo-First Strategy
**Insight:** Traditional "Hi, I'm [name], I do [thing]" is forgettable. Leading with "Want to see something cool? Call this number..." creates immediate engagement and differentiation.

**Implementation:**
- Voice AI Demo: +1 475-323-6801
- Use in first 30-60 seconds of conversation
- Let them experience it, don't talk over it
- Bridge to their business needs naturally

### Qualifying Framework (BANT+)
**Insight:** Standard BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) needs "Tech Readiness" for automation sales.

**Key Questions:**
1. How many leads per month? (20+ ideal)
2. What happens to after-hours calls? (identifies pain)
3. How do you follow up now? (manual = opportunity)
4. What's one new client worth? ($3k+ = easy ROI)

**Red Flags:**
- Under $300/month marketing budget
- DIY mindset ("I can build this")
- Under 5 leads/month
- Extreme tech resistance

### Industry-Specific Positioning

**Legal Services:**
- Pain: Calls to voicemail after hours, lost cases to faster competitors
- Hook: "What % of after-hours calls turn into consultations?"
- Value: 24/7 AI intake, case qualification, appointment booking

**Home Services:**
- Pain: Missed emergency calls, crew efficiency vs phone time
- Hook: "Never miss a service call at 9pm Saturday"
- Value: 24/7 answering, job detail collection, automatic follow-up

**Medical/Dental:**
- Pain: Front desk overwhelmed, high no-shows, intake bottleneck
- Hook: "How much time on appointment calls vs patient care?"
- Value: Automated confirmations, reminders, rescheduling, intake

**Real Estate:**
- Pain: Leads from multiple sources, response time critical
- Hook: "How do you handle leads when at showings?"
- Value: Multi-source capture, instant response, showing scheduling

**Professional Services:**
- Pain: Looking professional, calendar management, long sales cycles
- Hook: "What happens when inquiry comes during client meeting?"
- Value: Intelligent routing, automated follow-up, proposal tracking

### Follow-Up System

**Timing Matrix:**
- HOT leads: Email within 24 hours (demo invite)
- WARM leads: Email within 48 hours (valuable resource)
- COOL leads: LinkedIn within 3 days

**Sequence:**
- Day 1: Personalized email with specific pain point addressed
- Day 3: Text or LinkedIn if no response
- Day 7: Final email with case study (value-first, no ask)
- Day 14+: Move to nurture sequence, quarterly check-ins

**Template Elements:**
- Reference specific pain point mentioned
- Provide relevant case study/example
- Clear call-to-action with calendar link
- P.S. reminder to try demo

### Materials Strategy

**Print Handout:**
- Primary: Voice AI demo (largest, most prominent)
- Secondary: Digital business card (smaller, contact section)
- Keep it simple: Fewer words, bigger fonts
- Quality paper: First impression matters

**Digital Assets:**
- Voice AI always working and tested
- Digital card QR functional
- Phone charged
- Backup hotspot enabled

**Notes System:**
- Capture: Name, Business, Industry, Pain Point, Temperature
- Add personal detail (family, hobby) for follow-up personalization
- Log immediately (memory fades fast)

### Objection Handling Framework

**Structure:**
1. Empathize: "I hear that a lot..."
2. Clarify: Ask question to understand root concern
3. Reframe: Provide new perspective or context
4. Close: Offer next step or resource

**Key Reframes:**
- "Already have CRM" → "We're the automation layer on top"
- "Sounds expensive" → ROI math (1 extra client per quarter = paid)
- "Too small" → Small businesses benefit most (compete with bigger companies)
- "Tried automation before" → Customized for your workflow + training
- "Need to think" → Offer specific demo, make it easy

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why HTML instead of PDF for templates?**
A: HTML is easier to edit (any text editor), more flexible for customization, and can be instantly previewed in browser. Easy to convert to PDF when ready.

**Q: Can I use Google Docs instead?**
A: Yes! Instructions provided in `INSTRUCTIONS-create-print-handout.md`. HTML is faster for repeat use, but Google Docs works well for one-offs.

**Q: Should I commit these templates to git?**
A: Yes - templates go in repository. Instantiated materials (filled-in handouts for specific events) can stay local or in _inbox/drafts/ temporarily.

**Q: What if I need different QR codes for different events?**
A: Just export new QR codes and update image file names in HTML. Keep separate versions named by event (e.g., `handout-woodbury-nov2025.html`).

**Q: How do I update my Digital Business Card QR?**
A: Update in GHL, export new QR code, replace `digital-card-qr.png` file. All handouts will automatically use new version.
